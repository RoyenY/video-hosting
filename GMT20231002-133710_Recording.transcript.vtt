Rui Yang: Andre from Msc. Information security programs, I will present my dissertation by turning large language models to learn representations of militias code.

2
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:45.800
Rui Yang: First, let's learn about some backgrounds. Andro. Ecosystems rapidly go under open resource, natural attack, cyberaging and malicious apps to it.

3
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:56.340
Rui Yang: The prestole apps remains malicious and frightening users privacy and device security static and

4
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.369
Rui Yang: dynamic analysts. Malaysia's

5
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.579
Rui Yang: save things. But there's limitation of it.

6
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:18.990
Rui Yang: The first patients in static analyze understandables, equations in dynamic and analyze and their performance issues.

7
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.090
Rui Yang: One of the solution is the machine learning, detection.

8
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:32.569
Rui Yang: traditional machine learning approaches in militia, coast detection increase. There are a lot

9
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.530
Rui Yang: tractic regressions and decision. Cheese

10
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.660
Rui Yang: random 4 ways as we am, and naive, yet pay. Yes.

11
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.859
Rui Yang: the the Wendish of it is that it can be tagged

12
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.560
Rui Yang: up firstly, shit.
